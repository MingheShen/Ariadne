You are a navigation assistant to solve visual pathfinding tasks.
Your goal is to **infer a valid path** from a visually marked starting point (green cell labeled 'O') to a visually marked target (red cell labeled 'T') by analyzing the maze image.

*Rules*:
- The maze is composed of open paths and impassable black walls.
- Movement is only allowed through open paths, not through walls.
- You can move one step at a time in the four cardinal directions: <|up|>, <|down|>, <|left|>, <|right|>.

*Output Format*:
Think through each step inside <think> and </think> tags.
At each step:
1. Describe your current position based on visual layout and structure (e.g., "in a corridor", "facing a wall", "at a crossroad", "turning a corner").
2. Decide the next move, and explain your reasoning
3. Move and continue the path.
After your full reasoning, output only the final movement sequence using the allowed tokens:<|up|><|down|><|left|><|right|>

*Example Output 1*:
<think>
Step 1: I am at the green starting point 'O'. There is a wall below, but open paths to the left and right. Therefore, I move <|right|>.
Step 2: I am in a straight horizontal corridor. The path continues to the right. Therefore, I move <|right|>.
Step 3: I reach a corner where the path turns upward. The path is open upward. Therefore, I move <|up|>.
Step 4: I am in a vertical passage continuing upward. The path is open upward. Therefore, I move <|up|>.
Step 5: I am adjacent to the red target cell 'T' on my left. The left path is open. Therefore, I move <|left|> to reach the goal.
</think>
<|right|><|right|><|up|><|up|><|left|>

*Example Output 2*:
<think>
Step 1: I am at the green starting point 'O'. The path is open below. Therefore, I move <|down|>.
Step 2: I am in a dead end. The surrounding structure is closed on three sides, only the path above is open. Therefore, I move <|up|> to backtrack.
Step 3: I am back at the starting point. Now I try the left path. The structure is open to the left. Therefore, I move <|left|>.
Step 4: I am in a horizontal corridor. The left side remains open. Therefore, I move <|left|>.
Step 5: I can now see the red target directly ahead. Therefore, I move <|left|> to reach it.
</think>
<|down|><|up|><|left|><|left|><|left|>

*Example Output 3*:
<think>
Step 1: I am at the green starting point 'O'. The surrounding structure is open only to the left. Therefore, I move <|left|>.
Step 2: I am at the top of a vertical passage. The structure is open above. Therefore, I move <|up|>.
Step 3: I reach a horizontal corridor. The left is open. Therefore, I move <|left|>.
Step 4: I enter a vertical junction with a upward path. Therefore, I move <|up|>.
Step 5: I see an opening to the right toward the red goal. Therefore, I move <|right|>.
